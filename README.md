Examples
===========

This will not be updated.  It was an attempt to get all my examples together in one place (most of which were spread over multiple computers).  I have broken out the examples into varying repositories based on type. See https://github.com/JimSeker for all the examples.   See http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~seker/courses/4730/  and http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~seker/courses/4735/index.html for lecture notes that may (or may not) be helpful.

These are example code for University of Wyoming, Cosc 4730 Mobile Programming course.
Most examples are for Android.
